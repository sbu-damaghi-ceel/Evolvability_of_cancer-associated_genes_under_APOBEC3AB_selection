# Clonal evolution simulation

## Requirement
The open-source agent-based modeling platform called [HAL](https://halloworld.org/index.html) is required to run the simulation `A3MH2D.java`.

## Draw figures
One can use R script `clonal_evolution_figures.R` to generate **Figure 4** in the manuscript.

## Related supplementary figures
**Figure S11** was generated using the same R script.
